# Audiophile
Audiophile enables continuous 30-second audio recordings on Android devices using Termux, automatically transcribing them with OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model via whisper.cpp. Transcriptions are appended to a daily markdown file, facilitating seamless integration with Obsidian for note-taking and knowledge management.
